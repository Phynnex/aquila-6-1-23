# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## CONTRIBUTION GUIDE FOR AQUILA FOR FRONTEND TEAM
-----------------------------------------------

#### TO CONTRIBUTE

- Create a personal fork of the project repo on [Github](https://github.com/)

- Clone the fork to your local machine


- On your local system inside the cloned project, add the original repository as a remote called upstream.

  `git remote add upstream git@github.com:aquilabyeth/falcon-FE.git/`

â€¢ Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop. **It is recommended for every new feature you work on make a new branch and work from there.**

`git checkout -b develop`

- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.

- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.

- If the project has tests,please run them!

- Write or adapt tests as needed.

- Use gitignore for unnecessary file like node module

- (This is not necessary, but can be considered) Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase.
  Create a new branch if necessary.

- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.

- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch!

- If there are conflicts, please resolve them before opening a pull request

- Pull from upstream before pushing your code to the develop branch

- To keep to update with the main repo, be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.

- This way you don't miss changes


`git pull upstream develop` // this fetches and merge the upstream branch immediately
