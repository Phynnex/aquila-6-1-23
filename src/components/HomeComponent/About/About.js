            We can rapidly and confidently discover critical vulnerabilities in
            your mobile applications thanks to Aquila, freeing up analyst time
            that would be better spent leading and educating the development
            team. Additionally, Aquila offers a strong encryption shell around
            your application to deter hackers from accessing it and the data it
            controls. This enables your apps to work as intended while guarding
            against unauthorized access to them.
